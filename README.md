# cx_freeze GUI executable file maker
A GUI program to convert .py file to .exe file easily using cx_freeze.

# How to use:
The file is executable and it don't requires you to install any module or python. I have also converted it into .exe file. Just simply open it.


It is made using tkinter using python 3.6.3 and cx_Freeze 5.1
It might not contain all the options that cx_Freeze provide.


If there are any bugs or want any feature to be added, comment. I will add link to the source code ASAP.

Thanks
